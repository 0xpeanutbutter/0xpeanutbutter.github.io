'Coffee is not a addiction, it's a necessity'

This post is just about how I make coffee, Perfected it for nearly 2 years staying home during pandemic :)

## Ingredients

- Coffee

  - I prefer nescafe, I heard rage coffee is really good, but any coffee which doesn't leave any residue would be fine

- Milk
- Sugar

This has three stages

1. Beat

   - Here we take 1 and half 'coffee spoon' of coffee with 1 and half coffee spoon of sugar (add as per your taste)
   - Add one coffeespoon of lukewarm water
   - And Beat the shit outta that mixture
